# From Portland to Portland Project!
--------------------------------
### A simple HTML and CSS project for the Web Dev program at Practicum by Yandex

Still some stuff to work on:
* I had to use Z-index profiles to get the route66 opacity animation to work. Not sure how to do it otherwise without having the entire block inherit the opacities.
* Some pictures are inconsistently breaking when the device width is changed. Not sure what's causing it yet, if it's a code thing or a Chrome thing.
* Could use some sleep. Procrastinating is the worst.
* I was part of the group that got the wrong design file. I deleted the original HTML, but there are some styles leftover.

### Draft 2!

* Realized that the objects in the design file actually had names... corrected names to appropriate specs.
* Deleted all leftover CSS files from previous design with the wrong design file.
* Fixed some of the device incompatiblity, but may need to add additional break points.
* Moved folder structure to more BEM-friendly specs.

### Draft 3!

Lots of major changes
* Fixed the breaking layout. Took me forever to figure it out, but it looks way better than it did.
* Added padding at breakpoints for certain elements, especially the places block. Looks better, but might not be to spec.

### Draft 4!

* Added a breakpoint for the title to keep it from extended over the device-width.
* Fixed static margins in the "places" block.
* Other small recommended fixes.

### Draft 5!

* Switched outer margins to a calculated function instead of a finite value through separate "width" classes as per Liza's recommendation.
* Fixed footer text errors
* Switched logo to .svg
* Switched "places" block to a grid type layout instead of a multi-column flexbox
* Switched "cover" block to finite values as per reviewer's request
* Modified "photo-grid" to contain finite picture widths and modified grid to be responsive to the static widths
* Re-added font for styles of font-weight: 900

### Draft 6!

* Fixed bug in photo-grid picture width.
* Corrected miscellaneous font styles
* Fixed pictures in the "places" heading to be full width
* Other miscellaneous bug fixes
