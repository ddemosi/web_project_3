# From Portland to Portland Project!
--------------------------------
### A simple HTML and CSS project for the Web Dev program at Practicum by Yandex

Still some stuff to work on:
* I had to use Z-index profiles to get the route66 opacity animation to work. Not sure how to do it otherwise without having the entire block inherit the opacities.
* Some pictures are inconsistently breaking when the device width is changed. Not sure what's causing it yet, if it's a code thing or a Chrome thing.
* Could use some sleep. Procrastinating is the worst.
* I was part of the group that got the wrong design file. I deleted the original HTML, but there are some styles leftover.

### Draft 2!

* Realized that the objects in the design file actually had names... corrected names to appropriate specs.
* Deleted all leftover CSS files from previous design with the wrong design file.
* Fixed some of the device incompatiblity, but may need to add additional break points.
* Moved folder structure to more BEM-friendly specs.

### Draft 3!

Lots of major changes
* Fixed the breaking layout. Took me forever to figure it out, but it looks way better than it did.
* Added padding at breakpoints for certain elements, especially the places block. Looks better, but might not be to spec.
